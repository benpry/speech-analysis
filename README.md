# Speech Improve
## A project by William Nono, Ben Prystawski, and Ignas Panero Armoska.

>>> For Hack the North 2018 

### Project Summary

This project uses IBM's Watson Tone Analyzer and Stanford's Empath project to create feedback on how a speech spoken might sound like to an audience, thus helping the speaker rehearse. The project uses the Google Cloud Platform and is currently in a state where our python files are unhosted and so we are using ngrok for a webhook.

### Future Plans Include:
**Rehearsal/Memorization:**
 
If someone forgot a line, this project could be keeping track of where they were in a speech and remind them of the next part. 
 
**Timing Consideration:**

If someone has a speech that must last a certain amount of time, this project could help them keep track of if they are speaking too long or too short.
